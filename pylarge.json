When using PyGithub to make millions of GET requests over the period  of a few months we often pool the tokens of several researchers involved in the project, and use a scraper that dynamically switches tokens based on actual rate limits. \r\n\r\nHowever, writing this code is often a pain, as it requires messing with the internals of PyGithub. Recently, I started working on an update to PyGithub that allows you to pass in a list of tokens instead of a single token. Internally, PyGithub then does the switching of tokens, abstracting it away. \r\n\r\nHowever, I'm not sure if this feature is of interest to more users of PyGithub. If so, I'm open to discussing on how I could get these changes integrated into the mainline. \r\n\r\nP.S. Currently we're also running a study to help improve the sustainability of open-source communities, if you're open to performing in a single 60 minute interview on how you experience emotions when developing open-source software please let me know!"}}, {"doc": {"_id": 1686, "title": "Adding a team with permission to a repository is failing", "content": "Hi,\r\nI have developed below code to add a team with admin permission, which was working fine, till two to three weeks ago.

PRIVATE_KEY = decoder(os.environ[\"GITHUB_APP_PRIVATE_KEY\"].encode())[0]\r\n... APP_ID = 44107\r\n...

I was surprised by the low performance of the following script.\r\n\r\n```python\r\nimport pandas as pd\r\nfrom github import Github\r\n\r\ndef load(reponame, login, password):\r\n    # Log in to GitHub (see below)\r\n    gh = Github(login, password, per_page=100)\r\n    # Define the repository: reponame=\"user/repo\"\r\n    repo = gh.get_repo(reponame)\r\n\r\n    # Create a pandas dataframe\r\n    column_names = [\"Created\", \"IsPR\"]\r\n    df_issues = pd.DataFrame(columns = column_names)\r\n\r\n    issues = repo.get_issues(state=\"all\")\r\n\r\n    for issue in issues:\r\n        df_issues.loc[issue.number] = [issue.created_at,\r\n                    issue.pull_request != None, issue.labels, issue.milestone]\r\n    \r\n    return df_issues\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe script should load up to 100 issues in one request and process them in a loop.\r\nI have noticed that while in `for issue in issues:`, the script still utilizes network.\r\n\r\nDigging into this weird behavior, it turned out, that PyGithub can send a request to GitHub if a property value is not set:\r\n\r\n```python\r\n@property\r\ndef pull_request(self):\r\n    \"\"\"\r\n    :type: :class:`github.IssuePullRequest.IssuePullRequest`\r\n    \"\"\"\r\n    \r\n    self._completeIfNotSet(self._pull_request)\r\n    if self._pull_request is NotSet:\r\n        return None\r\n    return self._pull_request.value\r\n```\r\n\r\nSo when the script fetches 100 issues, `N` of them are pull requests. For those `100-N` issues the `pull_request` property value is not set. On each such issue a network request to GitHub is performed.\r\n\r\nFor my use case these http requests are useless, significantly decrease performance and sometimes make gthub to reject the request due to rate limiting.\r\nI already have this data. required. If `self._pull_request is NotSet`, then I can safely say it is not a PR, but an issue.\r\n\r\nI have not found a way to turn off this behavior in PyGithub's API.\r\n\r\nI think there should be a way to tell, that I dont want further hidden request when acessing an item (`GithubObject`)\r\nI think there should be an option to tell if hidden requests on an object are allowed.\r\nAt the moment the `_fetchNextPage` function of `PaginatedList` sets all items as not completed:\r\n```\r\nself.__contentClass(self.__requester, headers, element, completed=False)\r\n```\r\n\r\nA workaround might be to use `get_pulls` to retrieve all pull requests, but then the data is retrieved again, although it is already present when retreiving issues."}}, {"doc": {"_id": 1232, "title": "since arguement of get_repos", "content": "Hi all! \r\n\r\nI am trying to use pygithub to get a list of publicly available repos on github.

If you see `Framework` to be potentially reused by 3rd party packages like ours, and if you insist that no `tests/` shipped as part of the `github` package, may be it makes sense then to move `Framework` components to e.g. `github.testing` (analogous to `numpy.testing` etc)?"}}, {"doc": {"_id": 1097, "title": " PyGithub module does not work with Python 3.7.2", "content": "When try to running the simple demo after doing the installation throws the following:\r\n\r\nTraceback (most recent call last):\r\n  File \"<pyshell#0>\", line 1, in <module>\r\n    from github import Github\r\nModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'github\r\n\r\nOS: macOS Mojave 10.14.4\r\nPython: 3.7.2"}}, {"doc": {"_id": 1096, "title": "transfer issue", "content": "I wonder if the Beta  \"transfer issue\" will be available any time soon?"}}, {"doc": {"_id": 1095, "title": "Allow setting `name` for upload_asset", "content": "Currently, PyGithub uses `path.basename` for the `name` of the file assets -- could it be added that I can choose my own name?

The least surprising thing to do here may be to raise `UnknownObjectException` if there is no exact match for `ref`. Additionally, there may be value in providing a flag to return prefix match results instead of throwing an exception.\r\n"}}, {"doc": {"_id": 1046, "title": "Allow indexing in PaginatedList _Slice objects", "content": "I just got an error `TypeError: '_Slice' object does not support indexing` when I tried to\r\n\r\n```python3\r\ntags = repo.get_tags()[:25]\r\ntags[0]\r\n```"}}, {"doc": {"_id": 1045, "title": "Getting files from issue comments", "content": "So, I have a list of issues and there are some links there for files that attaches.

Which suggests that this is actually a bug in the code.\r\n\r\nFor an example for a \"bad\" event, I hope to have the relevant details here:\r\n`pprint(vars(event))` yields:\r\n```\r\n{'_CompletableGithubObject__completed': False,\r\n '_actor': <github.GithubObject._ValuedAttribute object at 0x7f8147b19a58>,\r\n '_commit_id': <github.GithubObject._ValuedAttribute object at 0x7f8147b21320>,\r\n '_created_at': <github.GithubObject._ValuedAttribute object at 0x7f8147b21358>,\r\n '_event': <github.GithubObject._ValuedAttribute object at 0x7f8147b213c8>,\r\n '_headers': {'access-control-allow-origin': '*',\r\n              'access-control-expose-headers': 'ETag, Link, Location, '\r\n                                               'Retry-After, X-GitHub-OTP, '\r\n                                               'X-RateLimit-Limit, '\r\n                                               'X-RateLimit-Remaining, '\r\n                                               'X-RateLimit-Reset, '\r\n                                               'X-OAuth-Scopes, '\r\n                                               'X-Accepted-OAuth-Scopes, '\r\n                                               'X-Poll-Interval, '\r\n                                               'X-GitHub-Media-Type',\r\n              'cache-control': 'private, max-age=60, s-maxage=60',\r\n              'content-encoding': 'gzip',\r\n              'content-security-policy': \"default-src 'none'\",\r\n              'content-type': 'application/json;

`Requester.__authenticate`, which is not the way **requests** library expected.\r\n\r\n# Solution\r\n\r\nDefined custom authentication function which uses `.netrc` file if-and-only-if `Authorization`

It is backwards compatible with the current codeset.\r\n\r\nThe user can set the retry parameter in the top level `github(<login>, retry = X)` call.  Where X can be a simple `int` to define the number of retrys or it can be an `urllib3.util.retry.Retry(...)` object.  This allows the user very fine grained control over the retry system as defined by urllib3.\r\n\r\nThe structure for the Retry object can be setup like this example:\r\n```\r\nnum_retries=3\r\nbackoff_factor=5\r\nstatus_forcelist=(500, 502, 504)\r\nretry_data = urllib3.util.retry.Retry(\r\n                                      total=num_retries,\r\n                                      read=num_retries,\r\n                                      connect=num_retries,\r\n                                      backoff_factor=backoff_factor,\r\n                                      status_forcelist=status_forcelist\r\n                                     )\r\ngserver = github(<login or token>, retry = retry_data)\r\n```\r\nThe urllib3 Retry object has many parameters, that allows the user much flexibility to configure retry's to their heart's content.\r\n\r\nThe only issue I have at the moment, is that I am completely baffled on how to add tests for this feature given the current testing infrastructure.  Any suggestions would be appreciated.\r\n\r\nCC: @mfonville @jrouquie @sfdye \r\n\r\nEDIT: The code for this PR is now stale, and is being moved forward via PR #1002.

Added the `assignees` attribute to the `Issue` object (e0e5fdf9c06be34d580aeca4829e7d53757bce89)\r\n    - In older version of API which doesn't support multiple assignees, `Issue.assignees` returns just a single-element list of `Issue.assignee`.\r\n2. Enhance support of `assignees` argument in `Issue.edit()` (14dd9f0850f4f280fd7bdb354860c88c5ca7356b)\r\n    - Some work have done in #466 already, but it now accepts a list of `github.Nameduser.NamedUser`.\r\n3. Added `assignees` argument in `Repository.create_issue()` (ba007dc8a8bb5d5fdf75706db84dab6a69929d7d)\r\n4. Added the `assignees` attribute also to the `PullRequest` object. (c0de6be5ea7d285f110ba82bb96bf6fe80b01945)\r\n    - Following the [comment](https://github.com/PyGithub/PyGithub/pull/469#issuecomment-261708142) from @andrzejchm, added the `assignees` attribute to `PullRequest` object as well. The diff is same as the first commit.\r\n5. Added the `add_to_assignees` and the `remove_from_assignees` methods to the `Issue` object. (66430d7831aa31beb726efa4a3ea25f2c7950819)\r\n    - Following the [comment](https://github.com/PyGithub/PyGithub/pull/469#issuecomment-262274782) from @mgorny, added the `add_to_assignees` and the `remove_from_assignees` methods to the `Issue` object, each of which utilizes [the \"add assignees to an issue\" API](https://developer.github.com/v3/issues/assignees/#add-assignees-to-an-issue) API and [the \"remove assignees from an issue\" API](https://developer.github.com/v3/issues/assignees/#remove-assignees-from-an-issue) respectively.\r\n    - These methods are to modify assignees on an issue without changing the existing assignees. To set assignees ignoring the existing assignees or to clear all assignees, use `edit` method like `issue.edit(assignees=['user1', 'user2'])` or `issue.edit(assignees=[])`.\r\n\r\n### Note for maintainers\r\n\r\nAll of the `ReplayData` is edited manually by my hand, since I could not edit issues on this repo.\r\nIf that is problematic, feel free to overwrite them!"}}, {"doc": {"_id": 468, "title": "More portable LICENSE?", "content": "Didn't know this was a GPL license, as they're pretty rare to find in python.\n\nwww.github.com/tony/patches is MIT and can't use viral code.

So I cheerfully went off and built my cache of pickled issues.\n\nThe scan is roughly:\n\n``` python\nfor github_issue in repo.get_issues(state=u'all'):\n    digest(github_issue)\n```\n\nNaively I now yearn to write `repo.get_urls_of_issues(state_u'all')`\n\nThe wonder of pygithub is that I really didn't need to read the github doc at all; but I feel there may well be more to this.  For example how deep is the save/load?  Do I have to cache users, milestones, label objects too?  If so patching the restored objects looks tedious.\n\nIn more grandiose thinking ... it might be possible ... to plumb a mode into pygit that always has a cache of pickled objects and which try those+update whenever possible.  Looking at the fetching code made it clear that I shouldn't try to do that and I really ought to get back to the real work.\n"}}, {"doc": {"_id": 281, "title": "set_label add_to_labels no longer works", "content": "```\nIn [11]: g = Github(settings.GITHUB_USERNAME, settings.GITHUB_PASSWORD)\n\nIn [12]: repo = g.get_repo('...')\n\nIn [13]: issue = repo.get_issue(2973)\n\nIn [14]: issue.set_labels('exception')\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\nUnknownObjectException                    Traceback (most recent call last)\n<ipython-input-14-5171ec2f3edf> in <module>()\n----> 1 issue.set_labels('exception')\n\n/Users/.../.virtualenv/lib/python2.7/site-packages/github/Issue.py in set_labels(self, *labels)\n    372             \"PUT\",\n    373             self.url + \"/labels\",\n--> 374             input=post_parameters\n    375         )\n    376 \n\n/Users/.../.virtualenv/lib/python2.7/site-packages/github/Requester.pyc in requestJsonAndCheck(self, verb, url, parameters, headers, input, cnx)\n    167 \n    168     def requestJsonAndCheck(self, verb, url, parameters=None, headers=None, input=None, cnx=None):\n--> 169         return self.__check(*self.requestJson(verb, url, parameters, headers, input, cnx))\n    170 \n    171     def requestMultipartAndCheck(self, verb, url, parameters=None, headers=None, input=None):\n\n/Users/.../.virtualenv/lib/python2.7/site-packages/github/Requester.pyc in __check(self, status, responseHeaders, output)\n    175         output = self.__structuredFromJson(output)\n    176         if status >= 400:\n--> 177             raise self.__createException(status, responseHeaders, output)\n    178         return responseHeaders, output\n    179 \n\nUnknownObjectException: 404 {u'documentation_url': u'https://developer.github.com/v3/issues/labels/#replace-all-labels-for-an-issue', u'message': u'Not Found'}\n\nIn [17]: repo.get_label('exception')\nOut[17]: <github.Label.Label at 0x10d4ba490>\n```\n\nSame exception happens whatever method I use to set labels.\n\n```\nIn [19]: label = repo.get_label('exception')\n\nIn [20]: issue.add_to_labels(label)\n\nUnknownObjectException: 404 {u'documentation_url': u'https://developer.github.com/v3/issues/labels/#replace-all-labels-for-an-issue', u'message': u'Not Found'}\n```\n"}}, {"doc": {"_id": 280, "title": "Adding unaffiliated members in now broken (API changes)", "content": "https://developer.github.com/changes/2014-08-05-team-memberships-api/\n"}}, {"doc": {"_id": 279, "title": "commit.author returns NoneType, if author is not an active GitHub username", "content": "The only way to find the date of the commit is to get the author or commiter and get the date from either one.

My original question was something to the effect of \"is there a way to get a repo by its id rather than its name?\" The motivation for this is, while a repo's name can change, its id cannot.\n\nTo summarize what James said:\n\n> We haven't documented this yet, however you've welcome to use repository endpoints like this:\n> \n> /repositories/:id\n> \n> For example, these two curls produce identical results:\n> \n> curl https://api.github.com/repos/github/linguist\n> curl https://api.github.com/repositories/1725199\n> \n> These should eventually be documented, however I can't promise exactly when that will be. However, you can definitely rely on these endpoints.\n\nThis also works with private repos, provided an access token is included in the request and the user has sufficient permissions.\n\nAs far as I can tell, this functionality is not provided in PyGithub. James indicated that this will eventually be documented and is a stable endpoint, so I think it should be included in the library.\n\nExamples of how I think this should work:\n\n``` python\ngh = github.Github('my_access_token')\nrepo = gh.get_user().get_repo(1234567)\nrepo = gh.get_repo(1234567)\n```\n\nThe only issue I see with this is that `get_repo` would be delegating to one of two endpoints, `/repos/:owner/:repo` or `/repositories/:id`, depending on whether a name or an id is passed in. The other option would be to have an explicit `get_repo_by_id` which seems less ideal.\n\nI'm hoping to work on a PR when I get a chance this week.\n\nThoughts, @jacquev6?\n"}}, {"doc": {"_id": 244, "title": "got multiple values for keyword argument 'headers'", "content": "```\nimport PyGithub\ng = PyGithub.BlockingBuilder().Login('login', 'password').Build()\nu = g.get_authenticated_user()\n```\n\n```\nTraceback (most recent call last):\n  File \"follow.py\", line 3, in <module>\n    u = g.get_authenticated_user()\n  File \"/usr/local/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/PyGithub-2.0.0_alpha.1-py2.7.egg/PyGithub/Blocking/Github.py\", line 186, in get_authenticated_user\n    r = self.Session._request(\"GET\", url)\n  File \"/usr/local/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/PyGithub-2.0.0_alpha.1-py2.7.egg/PyGithub/Blocking/Session.py\", line 88, in _request\n    request = requests.Request(verb, url, params=urlArguments, data=data, headers=headers)\nTypeError: __init__() got multiple values for keyword argument 'headers'\n```\n"}}, {"doc": {"_id": 243, "title": "Linux compatability", "content": "how do i install this program on Linux?\n"}}, {"doc": {"_id": 242, "title": "Python 3 compatibility", "content": "These lines cause errors in Python 3:\n\nhttps://github.com/jacquev6/PyGithub/blob/develop_v2/PyGithub/Blocking/_receive.py#L68\n\n```\n            except _ConversionException, e:\n```\n\nhttps://github.com/jacquev6/PyGithub/blob/develop_v2/PyGithub/Blocking/_receive.py#L120\n\n```\n            except (ValueError, TypeError), e:\n```\n\nIf I'm reading http://python3porting.com/noconv.html correctly, they could be written like this, which would work for Python 2.6 and later:\n\n```\n            except _ConversionException as e:\n            except (ValueError, TypeError) as e:\n```\n"}}, {"doc": {"_id": 241, "title": "v2 module names do not conform to PEP8", "content": "I noticed that the module names in version 2 do not conform to [PEP8](http://legacy.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/#package-and-module-names): \"Modules should have short, _all-lowercase_ names.\" The files in the `develop_v2` branch are camel-cased.

The signature of `GithubObject`'s constructor is changed to:\n\n``` python\ndef __init__(self, requester, headers, attributes, completed):\n        # ...\n```\n\nThus enforces initialization with header information and exposes all constructor call for modification. That reduces the chance of introduction bugs from human error such as forget to set header values, comparing to more simple solution such as introducing a simple `@property`. \n\nAll constructor calls are resolved to new signature incrementally and thoroughly tested along the way. The chances of introducing bugs are low (if there are any, it should only affect new features involving response headers).\n\nNew testing code for headers are also implemented by hooking up callbacks between `GithubObject` and `Requester` class. Thus every constructor call can be intercepted for assertion. \n\nAlthough this would be a more permanent solution, the downside is obvious for the relatively large amount of changes.

There are a couple of options:\n- Incorporate one of the snippets running around the web (e.g. [http://code.activestate.com/recipes/577548-https-httplib-client-connection-with-certificate-v/](this one from ActiveState); see also [http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3280603/adding-server-certificate-validation-to-httplib-httpsconnection](this StackOverflow discussion).\n- Switch to [http://docs.python-requests.org/en/latest/](Requests), and add a dependency on it and urllib3.\n- Switch to [https://pypi.python.org/pypi/urllib3](urllib3), on which Requests is based, and add a dependency upon it.\n- Switch to [http://code.google.com/p/httplib2/](httplib2), and add a dependency on it.\n- Switch to [http://pycurl.sourceforge.net/](PyCurl), and add a dependency on it.\n\nSome of these (especially Requests) are significantly higher-level than the current httplib approach, so they'd be a fair amount of change. I think httplib2 would probably be the smallest change of them all, and lots of people are likely to have it due to having Requests installed.\n\nThe first approach would avoid an external dependency when on Python 2.6 and up, but there's no `ssl` module in older versions of Python, so it'd bring in a dependency on M2Crypto, if those versions are still worth supporting.\n\nDo you have opinions on which route you prefer? I'm happy to implement any of them and send in a pull request.\n"}}, {"doc": {"_id": 168, "title": "Bug in user.create_key function 404 message Not FOUND", "content": "PyGithub version is 1.14.2\nIn our python module we are using this:\n\ngh = github.Github(cls._token)\ntry:\n      result = ClHelper.run_command(\"git remote show origin\")\n      has_remote = True\nexcept exceptions.ClException as e:\n       pass\n\nuser = gh.get_user()\nif not has_push:\n            # create ssh keys here\n            rsa_key = \"{0}/.ssh/dev_assistant_rsa\".format(os.path.expanduser('~'))\n            if os.path.isfile(\"{0}.pub\".format(rsa_key)) == False:\n                ClHelper.run_command(\"ssh-keygen -t rsa -f {0} -N \\\"\\\" -C \\\"Developer Assistant\\\"\".format(rsa_key), True, True)\n            public_content = ClHelper.run_command(\"cat {0}.pub\".format(rsa_key))\n        if not has_remote:\n            try:\n                ClHelper.run_command(\"git remote add origin https://github.com/{0}/{1}\".format(username, reponame), True, True)\n            except exceptions.ClException as e:\n                pass # TODO: what exactly happens here?\n        try:\n            user.create_key(\"DeveloperAssistant\",public_content)\n            ClHelper.run_command(\"git push -u origin master\", True, True)\nBut it failed with this:\n File \"/home/phracek/work/devassistant/devassistant/assistants/commands.py\", line 194, in _github_push\n    user.create_key(\"DeveloperAssistant\",public_content)\n  File \"/usr/lib/python2.7/site-packages/github/AuthenticatedUser.py\", line 399, in create_key\n    post_parameters\n  File \"/usr/lib/python2.7/site-packages/github/Requester.py\", line 95, in requestJsonAndCheck\n    return self.__check(*self.requestJson(verb, url, parameters, input))\n  File \"/usr/lib/python2.7/site-packages/github/Requester.py\", line 103, in __check\n    raise self.__createException(status, output)\ngithub.GithubException.UnknownObjectException: 404 {u'message': u'Not Found'}\n\nOr is there something wrong in our code?\n"}}, {"doc": {"_id": 167, "title": "Updates api reference url in docstrings for repository keys", "content": ""}}, {"doc": {"_id": 166, "title": "Complete listing of issues", "content": "The three APIs described in http://developer.github.com/v3/issues/#list-issues are not fully covered in PyGithub.\n\nThis was reported by mail by Daehyok Shin\n"}}, {"doc": {"_id": 165, "title": "Download error", "content": "```\n# easy_install-3.3 -U PyGithub\nSearching for PyGithub\nReading http://pypi.python.org/simple/PyGithub/\nReading http://vincent-jacques.net/PyGithub\nDownload error on http://vincent-jacques.net/PyGithub: timed out -- Some packages may not be found!\n```\n"}}, {"doc": {"_id": 164, "title": "Implement __len__ for PaginatedListBase", "content": "Not sure if I'm missing something, but it might be nice to get the length of a Paginated List.
