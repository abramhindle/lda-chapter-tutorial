Please use lossless compression with proper transparency instead.\nDear Telegram developers,\r\n\r\nthe Emojis in Telegram for Android seem to suffer from visible image compression, which gets especially noticeable upon increasing the message font size (which makes the Emojis become larger as well).\r\n\r\nTo me it looks like as if the Emojis would be images which are compressed using JPEG or something like that and as if they would have a lot of compression and maybe even chroma subsampling (4:2:0) applied to them.\r\n\r\nIn addition, the transparency of the images seems to be somewhat broken, because you can see a faint rectangle behind/around them.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately I don't know where those images are stored on GitHub, so I don't know how to look at them with a PC. Therefore I can only tell from looking at them from inside the Telegram Android app.\r\n\r\nAnd from there it looks like as described above.\r\n\r\nSo, could you please use lossless compression without chroma subsampling (i.e. with full chroma resolution, i.e. 4:4:4) for them instead? Like PNG for example?\r\n\r\nIt would be much appreciated.\r\n\r\nRegards",

As mentioned above, the Emojis currently seem to be compressed with a JPEG quality of 62 only, which is very very low.\r\n\r\nMaybe you could increase it to a somewhat higher quality value?\r\n\r\nHow about 80? Or 90? Or someting in between? Or maybe even 100?\r\n\r\nCould you please try? It would be much appreciated.\r\n\r\nOh, and another, alternative question:\r\n\r\n> @DrKLO wrote:\r\n> \r\n> Size is critical for android 2.x devices.\r\n> Also loading jpeg is faster then png.\r\n> No other solution for it until I will drop 2.x support.\r\n\r\nWith \"2.x devices\" you are referring to Android 2.x devices, aren't you?\r\n\r\nSo, how about using JPEGs for those old Android 2.x devices and using PNGs for all later devices (4.x, 5.x and so on)?\r\n\r\nWould that be possible?\r\n\r\nIt would be really nice if you would reply.\r\n\r\nAfter having increased the message font size and then having seen the compression artifacts on the Emojis in Telegram for Android, I can hardly unsee it, even when the Emojis are smaller.\r\n\r\nI compared them to some 160x160 PNGs found on the internet, and they look a lot better (cleaner, sharper, better colors).\r\n\r\nSo it would be really nice if you could do something about it.\r\n\r\nRegards",

Right now on android, there is only 1 tone for all Telegram users which is not customizable to know which user was written to you.\r\n\r\n+ Offer customized backgrounds for specific users or groups.\r\n\r\nThis idea came to me because I wanted my wife to have the zelda theme song, my mom the mario bros song and my boss dr robotnik which is not possible right now.

Also a \"paranoid mode\" could hold messages if the other contact is offline and send them only when both are online at the same time again.\r\n\r\nThis would really improve overall security from my point of view, although I agree it will make sharing the chat history of multiple clients very difficult.

Also, using the argument of \"[I don't like Android emojis](https://github.com/DrKLO/Telegram/issues/358#issuecomment-45840820)\" is not a good argument in my opinion, considering the application has a particularly large user base which may have a great amount of users who don't like iOS emojis.",

        "content": "Feature suggestion: Message types + filter on these types\nIt's my experience that often important messages get lost in the bulk of chat conversations. A solution could be to implement message types and the option to filter on these types. \r\n\r\nMessage types are already partially implemented. Telegram has \"special\" messages like images, stickers, documents, locations. I would suggest to expand on these types. Specifically calendar dates would be really useful. It's probably the biggest use case scenario of Telegram for people to plan a date. These special messages could be added through the \"attachment\" button in the chat client. \r\n\r\nOther (interactive) types might be polls (group decisions), checklists (to-do's) or starred messages. Although the interactive nature of such messages might be more difficult to implement. \r\n\r\nMost importantly, it would be great if we could filter on message types. Include a filter icon in the top-right of the chat with: images, links, dates, documents, locations, starred messages. \r\n\r\nI believe these additions could enable Telegram to become a much stronger social productivity / collaboration tool (positioning itself somewhere between Whatsapp and Facebook). \r\n\r\nIt would perhaps also eliminate/reduce the need for search (a feature which has a much bigger impact on the back-end load).

It is disturbing and people in the group can either discuss about the reasons for why he leaves or remains in awkward silence.\r\n(2) And in case of event organizing / event gatherings, it is quite discouraging if everyone sees kicking and leaving messages frequently. Messages of someone joined the group would be favorable, but not the leaving ones. It is also seen in Facebook groups which someone leaves a group is never displayed nor notified to everyone in the group.\r\n\r\nI hope you would consider adding this function.

I am currently on several groups and have more than 100 contacts using it, 2 similar features would help in how Telegram is presented to new users:\r\n\r\n1. Information Messages for User - This note style information box would show more information about a particular contact. Currently we only have the phone number and username. Other options could be added like where the user works, profession or simply dynamically giving the user the option to add several fields or text area type fields to add their user information. This way, other contacts know that this user has this type of profession, likes X type of stuff and more. This of course, limited to a permission based system where the contact can choose which input field to share or not.\r\n\r\n2. Information Messages for Groups - Similar to the user one but focused on what the group is all about, what it does, the rules or general guidelines that members of said group will follow and anything similar in that aspect.\r\n",

            "content": "I have no opinion about point 2., but I do about point 1.: the idea sounds great. However, I think in general we should refrain our prefered pieces of software from doing everything, and encourage each to do one simple job and do it well, while seeking interoperability (and that's key). Telegram is for IM, so let's have it do awesome IM. Other apps or services are for contact information, and can perform that job in awesome ways. And let them just communicate with one another. For example if you want to start/suggest/participate on an app that would allow people to publish contact information about themselves, it would be great. Then Telegram would be able to access that information.\r\n\r\nAs one example among others, there are Yellow Pages services that some addressbook apps (e.g. the one in Cyanogenmod, but I don't know about other versions of Android) already use. Maybe the Telegram client app or the Telegram server can query that as well since Telegram knows your phone number, and present it. It's just an example to show what you can do with interoperability as opposed to trying to do everything yourself, in your own closed way.\r\n\r\nTo show it the other way round: if you store and maintain information about yourself in the Telegram network, next step you'll want to share that information to other apps or people that are possibly unrelated to Telegram, in order to not maintain that information in several places, which nobody likes to do. So Telegram will in fact become a contact information provider, and as such it will have to implement e.g. a REST API and whatnot. You don't want to open that can of worms.",

Everyone can send you messages either you want it or not.\r\n\r\nI think that setting an account as private or the need to validate a given user the first time he wants to speak with you, if you don't have him in your contact list, could be a good fix for this. In that case I can still give my nickname instead of my phone number but if I don't have a given user in my contact list I will need to accept him.

If seems osx prevents the application from connecting to internet so that power consumption is useless.\r\n\r\n[MTTcpTransport#0x6180001158d0 system sleep detected, resetting connection]\r\n\r\nMoreover if application keeps running during dark wake there will be (I suppose) some inconsistency between memory footprint ad filesystem. In the case that the mac decides to hybernate because of SafeSleep the sleep image /var/vm/sleepimage will be taken during first sleep and not updated at every PowerNap wake up. In the case Messenger writes to the filesystem during darkwake and battery goes down during restore from image the memory will be \"rolledback\" while filesystem has been update thus creating inconsistency (I suppose).\r\n\r\nI suppose the last potential problem would be common to all darkwake running applications.\r\n\r\nGreetings,\r\nACF\r\n",

If a gif is not exactly squared it is not an issue but sometimes you have gifs which don't have the same ratio between sides, and really noticeable and it makes the gif impossible to see.

The simple reason is this:\r\n\r\nFor WhatsApp / Viber / Other MSG they save the images on the default image/video gallery folder. Telegram does not, so for most users, if they have both (Telegram and WhatsApp for example), the could receive an image on Telegram but never be able to share in WhatsApp.\r\n\r\nOf course, after I posted this, a new option was added called \"Save to Gallery\" which is disable by default. This of course addresses the situation in a nice way. Remember that not all apps are as opened as Telegram in the way that they do not search in other folders for images/videos. I would recommend setting the \"Save to Gallery\" enabled as default. Then if the user wishes, it could be restricted to only Telegram, this would make it more user friendly for the ones that wish to use both.\r\n\r\nMy intention with the several features I have proposed (And btw have all been added as of today) is to make sure that users SEE the benefits of Telegram versus any other and start migrating to it. Today I also did my second video about the benefits of WhatsApp versus Telegram, so I hope, with the changes Telegram has offered, more and more join in.\r\n\r\nWill be closing as solved.",

It's not so much preventing a screenshot but preventing the private messages from showing up in the app switcher. I don't want potentially sensitive messages or photos to appear in the app switcher.\r\n\r\nThe Telegram protocol is supposed to be about security and privacy, especially the secret chats. To this end, the app should provide options enhance privacy and security as much as possible. One way in which both are compromised is when you receive a message the sender's contact name is always shown. The secure lock screen doesn't leak this information, but the notification pulldown does and the unlocked notification bar does. I don't want to be showing something on my phone to a friend and have the notification \"Slutty McHugeTits sent you a message.\" pop up. Or having to worry about a girl looking over my shoulder on a date and seeing \"Monica Lewinsky sent you a photo.\" and having the inevitable \"WHO IS MONICA LEWINSKY\" discussion.\r\n\r\nI would also like to see the entire app and its data able to be protected by a passphrase so that the chat database is secure. If I was a reporter working in, say, Egypt, this would be very important to me. Bypassing a lock screen can be pretty trivial, but if the database is strongly encrypted then your secret chats are safe from the police. There is also the problem of the app leaking information in the cache directory, but I think if you are that paranoid then full filesystem encryption might be warranted.\r\n",

Telegrams UI is not affected by a changed size of fonts. This may be a cosmetic issue but it can also become a issue for usability when someone needs bigger fonts to be able to read properly.",

It can also be helpful to save data, when then people, like me, have a limit of 1GB or even less.\r\n4. **Add Version Info in Settings:** A new section have been added in settings (at the bottom) that shows currently version name, according to issue #391.\r\n5. **Show/Hide Last Connection:** This is the hardest one because with current API the only way (the one I used) is to avoid client sending \"online\" notification to servers, so other users can't know if I am online; they will only know the time when I decided to hide it as my \"last connection time\". According to this, this feature is client dependent so if using another client without this feature, this client will send \"online\" info and contact wil know it.\r\n6. Finally I added some strings needed to strings.xml (in English and Spanish).\r\n\r\nThere are some changes in *build.gradle* that I needed in order to compile my app correctly, but don't think they are needed in official version (except changing version number).",

        "content": "Render Markdown\n#102 mentions implementation of some HTML-like formatting. I think it would be wiser to use something like Markdown instead, for the following reasons:\r\n- It's already widely used, so many people are used to it.\r\n- Even when it's not rendered graphically, it still makes sense. For example, \\*hello\\* should render as *hello*, but even if the text is displayed as is, you understand that I'm emphasising. If you see \\*\\*this\\*\\*, it's clear to you that I'm **insisting**.\r\n- There are many libraries that can parse it easily, so implementation should not be a problem.\r\n- *Not* using an existing standard would mean creating yet another one, which would be a terribly confusing thing to do.\r\n- Any other arguments? (I will update the issue if/as more arguments appear.)\r\n\r\nOther related feature requests could be submitted as well, such as a toolbar for entering such formatted text, but I think that *rendering* Markdown would be a sensible first step.\r\n\r\nArguments against using Markdown:\r\n- Markdown doesn't do colours. On the other hand, IRC and particularly mIRC kids taught us that excess of colours is generally not very much appreciated. If you implement displaying colours, you also need to provide a way to *not* display them, since many people don't like them.\r\n- Anything else? (I will update the issue if/as more arguments appear.)\r\n\r\nOf course, Markdown defines semantics, not aspect. For example, there would be nothing wrong about rendering \\*\\*strong\\*\\* text as bold and blue, or even just blue. @fduraibi implemented a Markdown-like language that renders ^this^ as blue, for example. The important part is that it's emphasis. Think CSS.\r\n\r\nFor the sake of honesty, I should mention that I'm not particularly a big fan or user of formatting in instant messaging myself, because personally I use IM for communicating quickly, not for *redacting*. But I do respect that some people do need formatting, so I'm trying to propose a clean way to do that.",

Also if we agree on having colors, i think one or two should be enough.",

This is why this particular issue focuses on *rendering* a given input. In other terms:\r\n- It directly addresses the question \"How should I render a received text that contains \\*foo\\*?\". (And the proposed answer is: parse it as Markdown.)\r\n- It doesn't directly address the question \"How should I *send* text with a part of it stressed?\" (a.k.a. semantics). Asterisks or underscores are always nice candidates though, especially (but not only) when you know the receiving part will make sense of them.\r\n- It does absolutely not address the question \"How do I send bold, italics, blue text or red text?\" (a.k.a. graphics). In HTML, the \\<font color=\"red\"> years have long shown how bad an idea they were, but if anybody thinks it is indeed important to send colours with no particular semantics, that would fit in a different issue.\r\n\r\nI'm sure colours would be a nice tool to take advantage of on the rendering side though. If you haven't yet, I suggest you read [that introduction to Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/basics) first, and see where colours could help. One idea would be:\r\n- Render emphasis (\\*foo\\* in Markdown, \\<em>foo\\</em> in HTML) with that light blue you're already using. Default style in web browsers is italics, but it's only a default, and never an obligation.\r\n- Render strong emphasis (\\*\\*foo\\*\\* in Markdown, \\<strong>foo\\</strong> in HTML) with dark red + bold. Default style in web browsers is black and bold, but colours would certainly add to the effect!\r\n- Don't forget the \"strong emphasis inside an emphasised text\" case, or the reciprocal one.\r\n- Maybe render links as just underlined (plus bold? not sure...).\r\n\r\nIn any case, and if I may insist: \"How could I send blue/red/green text?\" would be off-topic here (and in my humble opinion a misfeature).\r\n\r\n@fduraibi and others, what's your opinion?\r\n\r\nOn a different matter, @fduraibi : I don't understand how slow phones are impacted by rendering, but I'm not an Android expert at system level.

Who likes this feature?\nOne of the most annoying features in Telegram is this \"Forwarded message From ....\" tag that gets attached to any message (text, photo or video) that you forward from other people. And that was the main reason for me forking this repo and creating a way to get rid of it.\r\n\r\nThe only times i find it useful is when I am quoting someone saying something personal, but never saw it useful for forwarding a joke, generic information, video, photo...etc\r\n\r\nThe way I implemented my solution is by resending the message as if was originated from the sender. But I don't like this approach since it means resending big video files for every recipient which defeats the resharing of the same object that is already shared on Telegram server. But that is the only way right now since Telegram links each object to its original sender (As far as I understood) while e.g./ whatsapp will allow resharing but without any association to anyone.\r\n\r\n* Why I don't like the forwarded from tag?\r\nMainly for privacy reasons, when I get a funny video, photo or text messages from the internet and I forward it to a friend, then that friend forwards it to his friends I don't want to be associated with some of these messages. Secondly:  i am mostly not the original author of the things i send so it is not my right to link my name to them, this is not twitter. And it is not just me who don't like it, all people I know who came from whatsapp don't like it.\r\n\r\n* Solution?\r\nThe way I solved it in my forked repo is by having an option in the settings to turn on and off the \"Forwarded...\" tag, if you turn it off the app will resend as if the original sender (see the changes here  https://github.com/fduraibi/Telegram/commit/4375bd22f0465eda9cbeaf62b4ce119b2e942fd4 and here https://github.com/fduraibi/Telegram/commit/46beaddac8e2f03b66c2f76069446c4cf96eed22).\r\nHowever, a nicer solution would be to add a new option in the message menu, so in addition to ```Forward``` which should send the message without forwarding tag we need another option e.g. ``` Quote and Forward``` that will keep the name of the original sender. Something like this:\r\n![tele-bug3](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/432460/2779465/4faec06c-cafc-11e3-9183-012af015c518.png)\r\n\r\nSo what do you users and developers think? do you like the app the way it is now, or you like such an option implemented?\r\n",

Also better to include a note that a message is part of split message (something like 1/3 2/3  3/3 )",

What happens is this:\r\n\r\n1. Someone sends me a message;\r\n2. The notification LED of my phone starts blinking;\r\n3. I alt-tab on my laptop to the CLI client and read the message;\r\n4. I reply;\r\n5. The notification LED keeps blinking, even though I spoke last.\r\n\r\nIt would be great if the app could detect when the last incoming message was your own, and stop blinking the LED. It could also remove the notification in the notification area, but that's not as important to me.\r\n\r\nThe CLI client can also mark messages as read with the /read command, and it also automatically does this when you reply. I'm not sure whether the Android app receives these /read notifications from myself, but I'm sure it receives my own chat messages because they show up. Stopping the LED blinking upon receiving chat messages from myself surely works, but perhaps it could also stop blinking once it notices I /read the messages. This would be especially great since the Windows desktop client for Telegram seems to send /read automatically on window focus (not that I'd know, but a few contacts run Windows and it seems to do this).\r\n\r\nThanks!",

Upon opening the Android app I can see my message is there, so the app certainly knows that I sent it.\r\n\r\nUsing /read in the CLI upon reading each chat message is a workaround, but it would be nicer if it would also stop blinking when I reply :)",

        "content": "Notifications Not Working *High Priority*\nA number of people that I have introduced to Telegram have abandoned it because they don't reliably get notifications when someone sends them a message. Apparently they don't get notified at all. This cannot be a settings issue as it has worked for them in the past, but has become more apparent over time. This appears to be a problem on iPhones, although I can't definitively rule out Android. I'd also like to add that I have a case where two contacts cannot see each other on Telegram at all, however they can both see and contact me perfectly.\r\nHave these issues been resolved?

When sharing something (article, youtube video, website) with Telegram the application that is doing the sharing will send the URL of that object to Telegram, however, applications differ in the way they do it. For example when sharing something from Firefox, Chrome, Youtube then \"EXTRA_TEXT\" will contain only the URL while \"EXTRA_SUBJECT\" will contain the title:\r\n```\r\nEXTRA_TEXT = 'http://www.youtube.com/something'\r\nEXTRA_SUBJECT = 'Watch \"Some video\" on Youtube'\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhile in other apps like Flipboard or Google Play Newsstand the \"EXTRA_TEXT\" will contain the title of that shared article and the URL:\r\nFor Newsstand:\r\n```\r\nEXTRA_TEXT = 'This is something cool http://www.something.com'\r\nEXTRA_SUBJECT = 'This is something cool'\r\n```\r\n\r\nFor Flipboard:\r\n```\r\nEXTRA_TEXT = 'This is something cool http://www.something.com'\r\nEXTRA_SUBJECT = 'Article: This is something cool'\r\n```\r\n\r\nso in my proposed fix first I added this\r\n```\r\nString subject = intent.getStringExtra(Intent.EXTRA_SUBJECT);\r\n```\r\nto get the subject\r\n\r\nand then this if statement \r\n```\r\nif ( text.startsWith(\"http://\") && subject != null && subject.length() != 0 ) {\r\n```\r\nto make sure that \"EXTRA_TEXT\" doesn't contain the subject already (so we wont have a duplicate title like the case with flipboard and newsstand) and that subject is not null or empty.\r\n\r\n![screenshot_2014-03-08-01-42-16](https://f.cloud.github.com/assets/432460/2366484/b109f6c8-a708-11e3-85db-6298f51c93e1.png)\r\n\r\nNote: I didn't do a pull request since I couldn't find an easy way to only submit certain commits (it involves branching and other complicated stuff beyond my knowledge) and since @DrKLO uses his own private repo for coding, so submitting something to the public one might be useless. @DrKLO if you like my solution feel free to copy and paste it into your main repo.",

(this feature is similar to whatsapp see picture).\r\nSo i think the best way to implement it is when the application receives a GCM regarding a new media message (not text message) and it calls the wake up routine to fetch the message information then when it is done, and before sending the phone back to sleep, to call the auto-download function if the conditions are true (Settings options are enabled, network is WIFI, ...) \r\n\r\n![screenshot_2014-04-30-19-02-33](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/432460/2848627/4e0d1e18-d0c2-11e3-9d98-4ddd287ed5ca.png)\r\n\r\nAs you see here, whatsapp has setting for mobile data, WIFI and roaming. And in each one of them you can select Image, Audio and Video.\r\nAudio here is not what you record by pressing the record button (voice messages) since whatsapp will auto download these regardless, but Audio is any audio file that you attach (mp3, wav ...etc) so for Telegram we will have Image, Document and Video",

However, what I would like to have instead is an option to auto download on wifi, so when I am for example at home and people sent me videos while i am not using the phone at the time the application receives the notifications if it is on wifi it will also download these videos so when I open it later I find them already downloaded and ready to play.\r\n\r\nI tried to implement it but I couldn't find the function that adds the video entry to the chat list!",

I'll only add a shotcut to share it when longpress... but this is another history.\r\n\r\nBut when videos come into play, is a different history... If you touch a video, you will reproduce it instead of open the inbuild gallery... and therefor your won't get the options... Let's suppose that you get into the inbuilt gallery and select the video... if you press the share icon, it won't show anything... and if you press options icon, you won't get the option to save it to gallery (... on /Movies/Telegram... for example).... An also you cannot get the share shortcut on longpress.\r\n\r\nI think the best approach is to rename /Pictures/Telegram to /Pictures/Telegram Images, and add the option to videos and save it to /Movies/Telegram Videos, in addition to the longpress shortcuts to all the attachments.\r\n\r\nRegards.\r\n\r\n",

Because \"Unterhaltung\" is a word only your Gradma uses when referring to people having a conversation? \r\n\r\nI rather think using a German word is fine. To start a \"Unterhaltung\" has a different meaning than to start a \"chat\". A \"chat\" is mostly referred to as text-only messages exchanged in a chat room on the web. But we are past that and Telegram is hopefully offering something that is more than what we refer to as \"chat\" in German. You can send pictures, soon audio, etc. I think it is perfectly fine to call that a conversation / \"Unterhaltung\". \r\n\r\nYou could argue not to translate \"secure\" to \"geheim\" but please phrase it a little different than you did, because \"It would sound like my grandma translated this app.\" is a little far off imho.",

So, when the repository is updated, the new strings to be translated appear automatically in Transifex\r\n- it offers a common place to discuss about translations (see for instance https://www.transifex.com/projects/p/telegram/language/it/discussions/)\r\n- there's a simple and yet very powerful translations interface: there's no need to work on text files with some text editor, you can view only untranslated entries, you can add comments and discussions to every string\r\n- it implements a common and clear place where translators are structured in coordinators, reviewers and translators, and having some reference people for translations is great (both for the project maintainer and for other translators)\r\n- the repository on GitHub won't be filled up by thousands of concurrent and overlapping translation-related pull request\r\n- there's a great command-line tool (the so-called *Transifex client*) that allow to fetch the translations from the Transifex server, so this process can be integrated into the build process to have always up-to-date translation files\r\n\r\nBest wishes ",

What do you mean with \"if the translation has allready been moved to Transifex\"? Moving to Transifex is very easy, and IMHO it has already been done (see the [Telegram project](https://www.transifex.com/projects/p/telegram/) on Transifex).\r\nWhat remains is to take out the languages from the GitHub repository (the `strings.xml` files from the `main/res/values-…` folders) and create a build task that fetches them from Transifex, or creating a scheduled task that periodically fetches these translations and updates the repository.\r\nIMHO the second option is better, since we have also a history of changes maintained by commits. \r\n\r\n> IMHO GitHub offers a very comfortable place for discussions too (how do I drop images in Transifex discussions again;-)\r\n\r\nI agree with you that GitHub offers a better discussion system: it's really powerful. BTW, I think it's quite a mess to have core-related discussions mixed with language-related discussions. Let's think to the future: if Telegram will get translated in 50 languages (like for instance for [concrete5](https://www.transifex.com/projects/p/concrete5/)), how many translations-related discussions we'll have? In Transifex every translators' group have its own place, and everything is really clean and clear.\r\n\r\n> some people like working on text files with some text editor (unlike an overdressed and slow web interface, it is fast and good for overview and keeping things in context)\r\n\r\nIn Transifex you can always download the text file, translate it offline and upload it. You can do it also via shell scripts (using the Transifex client). So, people that want to work with a comfortable interface can use the Transifex client, and people that prefer text files are free to do it.\r\n\r\n> beside it's fine structure. The coordinators, reviewers and translators it feels closed and restricted in a way too\r\n\r\nIMHO it's a better approach. Let's do an example: what if someone submit a pull request in GitHub to update a language file? Who decides if that PR is valid and, for instance, does not contain fake translations (buy Viagra or something like this)? Currently, only the repo maintainer can accept/refuse pull requests, but he may not know the specific language (for instance, I really don't understand anything of Chinese texts...).\r\nUnder Transifex the translations can be accepted by every translation groups maintainers: the GitHub repo maintainer does not have to do it, and the Transifex maintainers should know what they are doing...\r\n\r\nBest regards,\r\nMichele",

This is regardless of their timeout status and the set timeout length, even with just 2 seconds. It can be reproduced if the sending party dismisses the secret chat session and the receiving party only ever opens the chat after the dismissal.\r\n\r\nTL;DR: Bug where timeout is rendered useless if secret session is ended.",

You seem to have a great knowledge of what you are doing and you are trying to get the best out of every phone and Android itself.\r\nOn the other site, I just like everybody else would appreciate that this project will not go down, because you simply have enough of doing this all on your own. If you really want help you have to meet us half way.\r\n\r\nI know that there are people out there who want to help you, but it is nearly impossible the way the code is currently build up. I think it is also not only a help to them but to you too. It is easier to read just one or two lines of comments instead of 100 lines of f*cked up code that you wrote, because at that point you had no better idea how to deal with the given problem (happens to all of us).\r\nSome lines of comments are really easy to write. A function/method documentation is created with a simply keyboard shortcut in every Java IDE and you just need to fill in the blanks of what the function/method does and what the parameters are for. It takes about 30 seconds to do it WHILE programming and it helps you to order your thoughts and focus on the steps you need to do next to achieve what you want to do next.\r\nNo one wants you to sit down for three days to document the whole project all at once (even it would be really nice^^). But if you could include it in your daily coding, that would be great.\r\n\r\nIt really takes less time than you think it does and helps no only you, but everyone wanting to participate and help you with this Telegram client.",

And I can't even pick third party camera app integrated with Telegram. If I snap any picture and send it to my contacts, I must manually open camera app, and share it to my contacts.\n\nI hope you will consider it. \n\nThanks in advance.",

Using the same connection, same phone, same time of day. Well lets look at file sizes sent, we see Whatsapp video size is 4.3MB 352x640 (19 seconds)  , Telegram 23MB 720 x 1280 (19 seconds).  \r\n\r\nTo match or better WhatsApp the main rival, we need to offer the 'option' to resize the recorded video on top of the option to compress. I would recommend high, medium and low for usability under a guise of 'quality' vs 'bandwidth', perhaps offering  3 customizable settings behind 3 buttons presented as a final stage in the composition of the video. 'Mobile', \"Lan\" and \"Best\".  Maybe also provide the option to 'save for this connection type' and not ask again. Later changeable in the application settings of course.  This way, unwitting users get to see this enhanced ability over what WhatsApp provides whilst not risking the chance of getting in the way. At best you exceed in making a smaller or at least comparable file size over WhatsApp, but provide options above and beyond. Adding the option to up the quality level for those on fast connections / not needing to conserve bandwidth on mobile data tariffs.  \r\n\r\nCurrently the level of compression and no resizing results in a file size that is not best suited to a default setting.  This test was conducted on the Motorola 'Moto G'  (Android 4.4.4) over a WiFi lan connection, connected to the internet via a ~60Mbps ADSL uplink. http://www.speedtest.net/my-result/3895932800\r\n\r\nAs a side note; the upload to Telegram provided a throughput of 495.832 Kbps, WhatsApp; 489.244 Kbps, so both over a basic internet connection appear to offer the same throughput. So its all down to what you can do in the app.\r\n\r\n",

Telegram downscales all videos to width = 640, there can't be  720 x 1280 for compressed videos.\r\nThere never will be more options for compressing videos, it's for geeks, not for users.\r\n\r\nBy the way: Android is very bad in video compression, it doesn't provide good API for it. Almost on all devices with Android 4.1 and 4.2 all hardware decoders are broken by manufactures. So I don't think that anything will be changed here.",

On Moto G for instance, the actual downsize and compression operation appears to be failing, and a fall back position of sending the native video happens instead, hence a slower upload time coupled with much greater data usage. This has real world cost implications for users! Perhaps offering a fall back position where you revert to using a suitable device codec, because successfully downsizing of videos across a wider range of devices, means people don't get financially stung for exceeding unnecessarily high data usage. Add this to the fact that it will be far faster overall to complete sending of a video of 1 fifth the size, this offsetts any pre processing delays somewhat.\r\n\r\nSo to confirm, the video being recorded from the message thread in Telegram, via the paperclip, results in a video being taken that does NOT end up downsized and re-compressed. The native video is sent instead. \r\n\r\nI checked this from both within a 'Secret Chat' and a normal message type. ",

An initial download usually only occurs once, successfully compressing the video of course saves users time and money every time they do so. I bet that ranks higher in terms of desirability than saving 8MB storage, I wonder. \r\n\r\nPerhaps for ARM devices you could consider a tailored solution, once ARM is detected for example, the included codec is ARMV7 NEON. You could enable the app market to offer targeted APKs with various codecs for different platforms. You could wrap the codecs with a suitable abstraction layer and dependency inject the packaged codec implementation at run time. More of a plugin subsystem if you will. \r\n\r\n\r\n",

They detect what phone is asking for an install then the appropriate APK inclusive of an appropriate codec, is downloaded to the phone. You may notice in the app market, they specify Size as 'Varies with device' whilst Telegram is 9.8M.  http://developer.android.com/google/play/publishing/multiple-apks.html. Good luck whatever you decide but leveraging a good codec may well be the path to better compatibility and less effort vs baking video manipulation in house. \r\n",

If you don't hold a wake lock while transitioning the work to a service, you are effectively allowing the device to go back to sleep before the work completes. The net result is that the app might not finish processing the GCM message until some arbitrary point in the future, which is not what you want.\r\n",

Then both clients will see the same identicon (\"visualization key\", 'cause it will be a presentation of SHA1 applied to zero).\r\nHowever, judging by further manipulation with the \"shared secret\" key (because MTProto doesn't use Diffie-Hellman method of multiplying by g^ab^-1 or any multiplication by the shared key whatsoever) the multiplication by zero will not happen with client messages and they will successfully flow through the \"bare\" AES ( and therefore users will think that everything is fine and will proceed to transmitting sensitive data in this mode ).\r\n\r\nP.

Example @user1, @user2, ... @user38 - *your messages goes here*. All mentions will take more space than a text.\r\n\r\nWhat I see as feature to do - make a option to add my \"favorite hashtag\" and receive notifications if they are used. Or, if hashtag notification is too hart to implement, make hashtags star'able - if I click on hashtag, I can press some \"star\" button and see it in chat list.\r\n\r\nHope now I explain correctly my idea.

And the Emoji mess actually is one of the things which drove me to switch to Telegram.\r\n\r\nI was using surespot and TextSecure/Signal before.\r\n\r\nsurespot uses the Phantom Open Emojis on Android and the iOS Emojis on iOS.\r\n\r\nTextSecure on Android uses the native Emojis of your Android phone whereas Signal on iOS (TextSecure for iOS) uses the iOS Emojis.\r\n\r\nIMHO that's simply a mess.\r\n\r\nTherefore I switched to Telegram, because Telegram uses a consistent set of Emojis on all platforms, which is much better IMHO.\r\n\r\nAnd it's not just about messaging between Android and iOS. It's also about messaging between Android and Android.\r\n\r\nWhen you are using TextSecure on an Android phone which is using the Google Emojis for example and you are writing to someone with a Samsung Android phone for example, which uses Samsung Emojis, then the recipient also sees different Emojis than which you sent him (Google vs. Samsung Emojis).\r\n\r\nThat's simply a mess.\r\n\r\nWith Telegram you don't have this problem, because Telegram uses a set of built-in Emojis and uses the same set on all platforms, which, again, prevents such a mess from happening.\r\n\r\nIt's much better and a lot more professional that way.\r\n\r\n> @Multimoon wrote:\r\n>\r\n> [...] At this point your simply resisting change.

On keyboards like the one that ships with my device or the Google keyboard or SwiftKey for example, I have to press several buttons and/or have to press and hold buttons to reach the Emoji keyboard, which gets annoying very quickly. If you have a workaround for this, feel free to explain.\r\n* On the Telegram for Android Emoji drawer scrolling through an Emoji section works vertically (swiping from top to bottom), which is quite intuitive and makes for a good feeling IMHO. On other keyboards like the one that ships with my device or the Google keyboard for example, scrolling through an Emoji section works horizontally (swiping from left to right), which I personally do not like at all. I really hate that.\r\n* On the Telegram for Android Emoji drawer, I can see eight Emojis in one row and more than four rows of Emojis at once. On other keyboards like the one that ships with my device or the Google keyboard or SwiftKey for example, I can only see seven Emojis in one row and mostly only three rows of Emojs at once. So the Emoji drawer in Telegram for Android shows singnificantly more Emojis at once, which makes choosing and selecting among hundreds of Emojis easier.\r\n\r\n\r\nSo I actually do not want to use the Emoji keyboard from a system keyboard (because of the reasons mentioned above) and prefer the one that is built into Telegram for Android. And if it's background would be a bit brighter (https://github.com/DrKLO/Telegram/issues/843), it would be even better.",

On the default keyboard which ships with my device it does not work for example.\r\n\r\nOn the Google keyboard and SwiftKey for example, it does work though.\r\n\r\nTextSecure also has an option under Settings -> Advanced, which is called \"Enable Enter key (replace the smiley key with an Enter key)\", so that the user can disable it.\r\n\r\nBut TextSecure is about to change all of this and instead is about to use an internal Emoji drawer and an internal smiley button next to the message input box on all Android devices, just like Telegram and WhatsApp are doing it for example.\r\n\r\nYou can see the pull request for it over there:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/WhisperSystems/TextSecure/pull/2302\r\n\r\n>  @The0x539 wrote:\r\n> \r\n> Completely dependent on keyboard, especially on the size of the keyboard.\r\n\r\nAre you sure that the seven or eight Emojis per row amount depends on the keyboard size?\r\n\r\nI know that the amount of rows depend on the keyboard height. But what about the amount per row?\r\n\r\nIn the screenshots over there:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/DrKLO/Telegram/issues/961\r\n\r\nI noticed that he only has seven Emojis per row.\r\n\r\nBut he only seems to have a display resolution of 540x960, whereas I have a display resolution of 1080x1920.\r\n\r\nMaybe it depends on the display resolution and/or the DPI settings or something like that?",

At the top, \"Select Chat\" is displayed - **replacing this** with \"Share with...\" would make things a lot more apparent.\r\n* A default Android yes / no box appears when tapping a chat to share in containing \"Send messages to [user]?\". Not only is this incredibly unclear, but also cumbersome and irritating. Simply removing this would be an improvement.\r\n* **There is no way to edit a shared message before sending it.** This is by far the most important one. Twitter, for example, adds a weird little blurb (\"Check out @obskyr's tweet!\") in addition to the link you want to share - being able to edit this before sending would be really nice, and replace the \"are you sure?\" textbox.\r\n\r\nFor an example of the last one, check how Hangouts does it.

And yes, I know there is of course a \"mute\" button, as I believe it was previously discussed, however, Viber messenger had an absolutely genius approach here that would be, I hope, very easy to implement:\r\n\r\nThey had \"Smart Notifications\" as an option for each individual group chat. If a group chat was set to \"Smart notifications\", the phone would beep for the first and second message, and then it would simply go quiet *for that particular chat* and not beep any more at all until that chat is open and read.\r\n\r\nThe benefit of this would be that, unlike in muted group chats, you would at least have the first 1 or 2 sounds so that you would know that the chat is active and that you need to look at it later. I am not a big fan at all for fully muting conversations, and I think this idea worked brilliantly in Viber. But Viber is rubbish, while Telegram is so much better and I would love to have this option there.\r\n\r\n\r\nThanks for all the great work!\r\n",

You can achieve the result suggested by Darkwood77 by setting it to \"sound atmost 2 times in my lifetime\". A user with different needs can set it to \"sound atmost 2 times in 2 hours\". Or, otherwise \"sound always\", at which point app would disable the duration selection part.\r\n\r\nHope this helps. ",

And I can illustrate with a few examples:\r\n\r\n-Quite a few times already I have noticed that while I was typing a message in an open chat and had received another one in the meantime, I didn't even notice it as my visual concentration was mostly focused on what I was typing, not the chat above. It was only after I sent my own message that I had noticed a couple of new ones popped up there. If there was a small quite chime alerting me that these messages have appeared, I would have noticed them.\r\n\r\n-My friend has a very long screen timeout, he tells me that in a fairly active chat on whatsapp he will leave the conversation screen open as he doesn't want the default loud notification beep over and over again, so he just picks his phone up when he hears the quiet chime of a new message arriving. He cannot do this in Telegram as new messages to the open chat do not have sound notification. \r\n\r\n-I myself have often noticed that I took my eye off the chat, and only an hour or so later noticed that 1 or 2 messages have arrived that I have never noticed, as there was no sound, and the screen timed out, and I thought that me and the other contact stopped typing only to see that they said something else and I never replied as I didn't notice the messages\r\n\r\n\r\nNow, I quite agree that a majority of people might not have a need for this, and that is fine. However I am positive that a LOT of other people would find this useful, as nearly all my friends on android tell me the same. Basicaly, the mere fact that both Whatsapp and Viber actually work exactly like this, and furthermore, *that Telegram for iPhones also has this feature already* should pretty much speak for itself.\r\n\r\nI believe it should be very easy to implement this, and quiet honestly, I cannot think of a good reason not to. I think Telegram is much better than Whatsapp, but missing this feature is very annoying.",

        "content": "Gif recognition without gif extension\nHi!\r\n\r\nI am loving the Telegram client and the latest changes, it is pretty cool and in Lolipop it is perfect. \r\n\r\nI have noticed something in the past days that I think has been there forever but only recently I have known what is the reason. I use pushbullet a lot to pass gifs or pictures from de pc to my phone and sometimes pushbullet doesn't get the image name complete but depending on the site you are sending them from it gets some code for it. For example, a downloaded image can be named either image.gif or something like 34-199+-4.\r\n\r\nAndroid has no problem with it, it knows that it is a gif and when you open it with the Photos app it works great but Telegram doesn't. If you send it from the photos app it only sends the first photogram, as a picture. The same if you send it as a document from Telegram. If I rename the file to something like picture.gif, then it sends a gif without issues, so it seems that without the extension Telegram doesn't know that the picture is a gif.\r\n\r\nI thought that since more changes are coming in the gifs sharing direction and people are getting pictures from several different sources maybe this could be fixed since sometimes the extension might no be there.\r\n\r\nThanks!",

In Spain Telegram is becoming popular and a lot of people managed to make something similar with Wahstapp given that the messages were not encoded so they could easily read them from outside, for example (it sounds pretty secure though...). They are now asking if it would be possible to do it with Telegram and maybe to have an official way of interacting with it would be awesome.\r\n\r\nThanks!",

A message comes and all devices ring. That is fine, Telegram doesn't know which one are we using but then I start talking with my pc, now Telegram knows that I am on the pc, why every message that I get sounds in all three devices? One of the best things of Telegram is the ability to use it in many different devices but the fact that you might receive the same notification many times at the same time usually makes people not count on this advantage because it is annoying. Hangouts for example avoid ringing all devices once you opened the conversation in one of the activated ones. Then it has some sort of timer and when there is inactivity for a period of time a new message will ring again in all devices.\r\n\r\nIs there any plan to implement this? It would be really nice!",

I may be wrong, so please correct me if so.\r\n\r\nI am also not aware of devices that do not support this feature. Older Android versions do not support screenshots at all (except rooted ones) and the newer ones that I have tested do support it. It is an Android built-in feature and only if a vendor removes it, it will not work.\r\n\r\nI think that it is an important feature in many scenarios. For example, when on a private chat with the self-destruct option enabled, one party can take screenshots of the conversation and reveal them to the public. Or in the case when someone has physical access to a device, might want to take a screenshot of some private conversation and forward it to himself.\r\n\r\nIn the beginning my goal was to have an option to disable screenshots at conversation level, so that it is guaranteed that both parties cannot take screenshots, but because Telegram does not handle conversations as activities, it is impossible without a restart. An indicator on private chats could notify whether the other party can take screenshots or not.\r\n\r\nObviously this feature does not aim to substitute the already existing security, but it can give it a boost.",

I have seen apps like TextSecure using the feature (optionally), but I am not sure if it works on all devices and if Moxie has used workarounds in order to make it happen.\r\n\r\nI think that knowing that the other party can take screenshots is important for privacy. Alerting one party that the other took a screenshot may be disrespecting the second party's privacy, but this can be debated. Personally I think that alerting/disabling/whatever screenshots is important and should be included in Telegram. I would be happy if I knew that the other party has enabled or disabled screenshots, but since you say that it is unstable, maybe notifying for them is the only option.\r\n\r\nAs for the notification icons, I am not a graphics designer, so if you like them grab them, otherwise we can try to find someone who will do them better looking.

It's just disabled in opened chats,\r\n> because there is no reason to play something while\r\n> you looking on incoming or outgoing messages.\r\n\r\nThat's wrong. There _is_ a reason. Let me give you an example:\r\n\r\nLet's say you are at home and you are chatting with someone via Telegram-Android using your smartphone and you are doing some other things besides chatting and therefore occasionally have your smartphone lying next to you (i.e. not holding it in your hands).\r\n\r\nSo now you have your smartphone lying next to you with an open chat in Telegram-Android and you only want to pick up your smartphone (i.e. holding it in your hands) when your conversation partner has sent you a message so that you can reply to it.\r\n\r\nBut Telegram-Android does not give any audible notification for the newly arrived message.\r\n\r\nSo you are forced to constantly look at what is happening on the screen of your smartphone to notice if someone has written something or not.\r\n\r\nIf you would allow to enable an audio notification for incoming messages in open chats though, you no longer would have to constantly look after your smartphone screen.\r\n\r\nYou could simply wait for the audio notification to appear and then turn your attention to your smartphone.\r\n\r\nDo you understand the use case now?\r\n\r\nPlease, as already mentioned in:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/DrKLO/Telegram/issues/734\r\n\r\nplease implement such an option.\r\n\r\nIt would be _very_ useful. Not having the option to enable audio notifications for open chats can get annoying very quickly.\r\n\r\nSo, could you please do something about it?\r\n\r\nI mean, as already mentioned in:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/DrKLO/Telegram/issues/734\r\n\r\nthe iOS version of Telegram already seems to have this feature. So why not just implement it for Telegram-Android as well?\r\n\r\nIt would be much appreciated.\r\n\r\nRegards",

I am not talking about the lack of Telegram API support for individual messages unread status, but about the actual Android implementation of unread count in the icon/widget.

This may or may not be correct, this is irrelevant to my question. Let us assume the worst case scenario: MTProto is fully broken. Secret chats use Diffie-Hellman key exchange, which is known to be secure. Which leads to my quesiton:\r\n\r\nAre DH and MTproto bundled tightly in such a  way that a weakness in MTProto breaks Diffie-Hellman? or is it safe to assume that Diffie-Hellman is loosely coupled in such a way that it will remain secure even in case MTProto turns out to be weak?",

It got replaced first by WPA-TKIP which also uses RC4 but with a good implementation.\r\n\r\nAlso since the key exchange still passes through the Telegram servers then there is nothing that stop them from intercepting the key-exchange and becoming the middle man. the only way to have a really secure connection is to make a direct connection between the two parties and not through a third entity.

Please look up \"RSA\", \"Diffie Hellman Key Exchange\". Even if you rely on an evil server to facilitate your connection, a secure channel can be established. The only problem: You must first meet with the other party and exchange a so called \"key\" securely. Once the key is securely exchanged between Bob and Alice (e.g. they meet in a bar and exchange usb sticks) the two people can talk securely forever even if the facilitating server is not secure. This is how PGP, Telegram, and other systems work. At the core lies either Diffie Hellman or RSA.\r\n\r\nTelegram-specific:\r\nTelegram uses Diffie Hellman. But instead of meeting in a bar and exchanging USB sticks, you just meet up with your friend and compare these:\r\n![key_image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/5030488/3474839/23252750-02e9-11e4-888c-32b7bd377761.jpg)\r\n\r\nIf the keys look the same on the two phones, then the keys have been exchanged without tampering, and the two people can talk securely, forever.\r\n\r\nNote that this would fail if other portions of the protocol are not secure, and this is why I opened this question in the first place ;) . To ask whether other aspects of Telegram are not secure.\r\n\r\nIf you want to dive into the world of \"end to end encryption\", I suggest you start with PGP. It works on top of Email, and even though the Evil Email Servers facilitate communication, no one can decrypt it. Unlike Telegram, PGP has proven security.

With this, IRC is a fairly proven technology and is relatively well-known and simple to use for the most part. A channel on Freenode would suffice quite well.",

I used to use IRC daily and even managed a server and its channels for about 3 years and I know its problems and limitations. \r\n- It is not easy to new comers to use it. \r\n- I forgot my nick password on freenode, and the only way to recover it is to join the #freenode channel and hope one of the ops are active so he/she can help you reset it!! \r\n- You cannot share a file easily with all users\r\n- You have to an IRC client up and running all the time to not miss old conversations.\r\n- You cannot hide your IP address on freenode servers (as far as i know)\r\n\r\nThe group I am suggesting on Telegram would be only for development. I have a google voice number that I use when testing Telegram and thing I develop for it. So we can do that same, create numbers just for this purpose (if you don't want to use you real number) and then one of us creates the group and announces the number here so others can send join requests. We can have one group for development and another for other questions. Maybe someone can create a script that uses the Telegram linux cli client to auto invite people when receiving a special message (such as \"Register\")\r\n\r\nAnyways, I am up to what the majority agrees with. If we agree on Telegram group I can create that group and invites other devs. and if we decide on IRC then we can try to claim the #telegram channel since it is not active (see info below)\r\n```\r\n[16:10] [Notice] -ChanServ- Information on #TELEGRAM:\r\n[16:10] [Notice] -ChanServ- Founder    : Ushanka\r\n[16:10] [Notice] -ChanServ- Registered : Dec 26 06:06:40 2008 (5 years, 18 weeks, 5 days, 14:04:02 ago)\r\n[16:10] [Notice] -ChanServ- Last used  : Jan 07 05:58:49 2009 (5 years, 17 weeks, 0 days, 14:11:53 ago)\r\n[16:10] [Notice] -ChanServ- Mode lock  : +ntc-slk\r\n[16:10] [Notice] -ChanServ- *** End of Info ***\r\n```\r\nor simply register a double hash channel (like ##telegram-android) not sure if we can register a primary channel (one hash) while we are not the project owners!\r\n\r\nThat is all, nothing personal but what I think is better.

If you messed up, or just to be sure, do another replace in path on config folder and replace every org.telegram.telepatch.telepatch with org.telegram.telepatch --> that happens. Frequently. Do it also in org.telegram.telepatch folder.\r\n2-again. open androidmanifest inside src/main and do replace all org.telegram to org.telegram.telepatch \r\n(if not done already)\r\n3. another replace in path like that one, but this time replace in jni folder org/telegram/ with org/telegram/telepatch/\r\n4. last replace in path in jni, replace Java_org_telegram with Java_org_telegram_telepatch\r\n5. rebuild ndk libs from command line (<ndk-path>/ndk-build <your-jni-folder-path>)\r\n6. If it goes in error, you screwed up, do other edit to match the pattern \"org.telegram.telepatch\"\r\n6-bis. If Android Studio drives nuts, restart it. It helps.\r\n7.try install it. It should work (tested with source of 1.5 stable)\r\n\r\nif it goes again in \"native method not found\", just rebuild the ndk source.\r\n\r\nIn the end you will have your fork up and working and you can publish it on Google Play Store.",

But after you opened/read the message on one device, the notifications don't disappear on the other devices. Also the unread counter inside those other apps (smartphone or web) isn't reset on the other devices. Result is that you have to open old messages on the other devices to be able to use the unread functionality again.\r\n\r\nThank you for fixing this.\r\n\r\nJeroen",

You are right about the link not being touched. No user input should be changed by any means. It could get validated or at most extended (for example with a preview image of the link image of course downloaded and compressed on the sender side), but never changed to something completly new, which it would be in this case.\r\nBut just because I mentioned the example above, I would never want it to be implemented, because also the sender has a data plan which would be exhausted by this behavior.\r\n\r\nAlso if the user has an infected link it does not by default mean that his phone is or got infected by visiting it.

Nothing is changed, just additional information is provided. The same should be done for Youtube links, and the same thing should be (and is being) done in the other Telegram clients like Webogram.

I think a server side solution is quite complex because when you have a number starting with 0170... you don't know which country this guy comes from. But why not \"translating\" all numbers on the client side before uploading the list to the server? The app knows that it running on a phone in germany and the country code is +49. It can just change every number starting with 0 to +49 and then upload it. Maybe this is stupid but it is simple and should work, or not?\r\n\r\nI'm no andoid developer nor a java devolper but Ialready saw usages of build in android functions to translate local phone number to internation ones with a + in front.\r\n\r\nBtw: I think in the Telegram iOS App it works better because a friend of mine sitting next to me today was seeing all Telegram contacts and he also had the national number format in use.",

Also, the push notifications did not work.

        "content": "Enhancements and new features\n##### Here is a list of thing that I believe need to be fixed/implemented so people will accept Telegram as a replacement for other messaging apps like Whatsapp, Line, Chaton...etc:\r\n- ~~When sharing Youtube videos (directly from Yourtube app or if it was received in whatsapp) Telegram will only post the URL and will strip the video title. (it would be also good if Telegram can show a small thumbnail of the video like whatsapp does).~~\r\n- When pasting a message that has been copied from Whatsapp the Emojies in that message will show like text emojis (the ones embedded in the font) and Telegram will not replace them with the picture ones.\r\n- Telegram doesn't allow creating messages with extra spaces and new lines, instead it will trim all consecutive newlines or spaces into 1 newline or space (i think that is done by the HTML object). This behavior sometimes breaks the message formatting specially if the message has ascii artwork.\r\n- Current message size is small (only 2048), (whatsapp has unlimited message size but that is not good since you can cause a denial of service by sending a huge message that can crash someones phone) a larger size, maybe 8K or 16K should be reasonable and still not too big.\r\n- Currently Telegram processes only 50 emojis in each message the rest will default to how the OS handles them. I am not sure why there is a limit if the message size is already limited. I increased mine to 200 and I didn't notice any effect on performance.\r\n\r\n##### This is a list of new additions that I would love to see in Telegram:\r\n- ~~Support of animated pictures, maybe user attached GIF or AnimEmoji (like Chaton and Line).~~\r\n- Support message formatting, using HTML tags or simple tags such as using before a line to make it bold.\r\n- When attaching a photo allow the user to select between attaching a resized and compressed version (for fast transfer) and this can be the default or to send the photo as it is (a feature that will be very useful when you want to share a photo with others and you want to maintain its resolution and size)",

The problem is that I am not a programmer, yes i know how to code in C and some other languages but mostly to get things done. I only wanted to update the Arabic language translation update and the rest of changes were intended to be included in my github repo only. but i found that all of the later commits where also included in that same pull request, I simply don't know how to do it for certain updates (first time to really use github and fork a repo).\r\n\r\nAnyway here are the changes I did in my fork:\r\n1- Update to very few strings in the Arabic translation file.\r\n2- The Emoji limit fix was an easy change of the number 50 to 200 in the if statement.\r\n3- The message forwarding is a dirty hack, it works (for messages, photos, and some vidoes) but that is not the right way to do it since I strip the messages from the forward object right before it get sent, videos sometimes don't work if the reference is on the server and not a path on your phone.\r\n4- Increasing the message size, I again changed the size from 2048 to 4096, however, I believe an 8K or maybe a little more should be a good size but currently anything more than 4096 is getting rejected from the server.\r\n5- Invisible mode, again it is based on trial and error, i traced the code back until I found where it sends the status, so the added option will make the server think that the app is running in the background all the time. So in my change for invisible mode other people will see the last time i was online (before enabling the option) while I can see them, however they cannot see when I am typing and I also cannot see them (maybe the server doesn't see me online so it doesn't communicate such information)\r\n6- Native Emoji, was discovered by chance since if you disable the emoji replacement (or set the limit from 50 to 0) the app will default to the android native emoji.\r\n\r\ni think that is all i did, again most of these are dirty hacks and might not work with future changes of the service. anybody is free to use them, fix them ....etc",

However, if the app support plugins, then developers can right small features as plugins and users will choose what they want to install.\r\n\r\nI don't know how such thing can to be implemented but there is few things that need to be in mind while doing it:\r\n1- Security: we don't want bad people making plugins that will cause harmful things, so there need to be guidelines on what do plugins have access to, creating a trusted plugins repository,  warning the user when installing untrusted/unsigned plugins ...etc\r\n\r\n2- Version control: maybe app should be aware of what parts of it a plug in is using so in case that part of the app got updated that plugin will get disabled until it is updated accordingly. The app should reject the installation of old plugins that are not compatible anymore.\r\n\r\n3- keep them open source: since telegram is GPL does the plugins need to be GPL as well?. Having them open source means they can be reviewed for security reasons also when a plugin is abandoned by its developer some one else can continue the work.\r\n\r\nI know this is such a big request at this time, but I thought it would be good to keep it in mind and prepare the future updates to be ready for such feature.",

For your own benefit, for the project's benefit, and for everyone else's.\r\n\r\nHere are the important points:\r\n\r\n- Commit as frequently as you like (but clean up for public consumption)\r\n  - Committing often during development is useful, and makes it easy to backtrack\r\n  - Before you push to a public repository, you may use `git rebase` to squash commits down into logical units of work\r\n  - This also transforms the merging of patches from being all-but-impossible to very-manageable\r\n- Use descriptive commit messages\r\n  - Doing so allows everyone (including you) to review changes (and determine what you were doing when you broke something)\r\n  - If you rebase before pushing, you can clean up your commit messages during the rebase\r\n- Use branches\r\n  - Ideally, you should develop features in topic branches\r\n  - If the above seems like too much effort, a simple segregation is to create a `develop` branch that can contain dirty/broken code, that once working can be merged into `master`\r\n- Tag releases\r\n  - Not doing this is just silly, and your excuse that it takes too much time is absolutely ridiculous.\r\n  - It literally takes one second to create a tag\r\n  - Doing so allows tracking of exactly what changed between versions, so that you can tell which versions are affected by a bug, for example\r\n\r\nIt will be absolutely impossible to maintain this as an open source project until you start using source control responsibly.  You're obviously new to software development, so all this may seem a little overwhelming, but if you think that source control is a waste of time, this project may as well already be dead, or closed source.\r\n\r\nEither this project is open source, or it's not.
